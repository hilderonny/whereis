# whereis
A maps based web application where you can add markers of different types. 
I use it to find containers for recycling glass or paper or to find postboxes 
near me.

Imagine you are in a foreign town and want to send a postcard to your friend 
but you do not see any postbox near you.

With this app you can search for postboxes around you and let it even navigate 
you to it.

You could also add new markers to postboxes or anything else to the app so that
other users can find them.
